# Subsets

> Given a set of distinct integers, return all possible subsets.

> __Notice__

> Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.

> The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.


## Example

If S = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:

```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Challenge

Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?
