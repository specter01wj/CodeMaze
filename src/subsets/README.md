# Subsets

> Given a set of distinct integers, _nums_ return all possible subsets.
>
> __Notice__
>
> Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
>
> The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

## Example

If _nums_ = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:

```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Challenge

Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?

## Solution

[C++](solution1.cpp)

[Swift](solution1.swift)
